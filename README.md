# URL Shortener Microservice

A simple microservice to shorten any valid URL. 
Hosted on Replit --> https://url-shortener-microservice.nicole-lancaste.repl.co/api 

## Description

This is a microservice project built as part of the [freeCodeCamp backend and API certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) (project 3 of 5)

freeCodeCamp give you a boilerplate project template that you can [clone here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener/)
however, I chose to build my own project from scratch including the server.

- TypeScript
- Node.js
