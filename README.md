# URL Shortener Microservice

A simple microservice to parse request headers, live version is hosted on replit here: https://url-shortener-microservice-1.nicole-lancaste.repl.co/

## Description

This is a microservice project built as part of the freeCodeCamp backend and API certification https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/ (project 3 of 5)

however, I chose to build my own project from scratch including the server.
