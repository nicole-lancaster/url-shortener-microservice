# URL Shortener Microservice

A simple microservice to shorten any valid URL. 

## Description

This is a microservice project built as part of the freeCodeCamp backend and API certification https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/ (project 3 of 5)

freeCodeCamp give you a boilerplate project template that you can clone here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener/
however, I chose to build my own project from scratch including the server.

1. Submit a URl of your choice - for the URL to be valid it must be in the format http:// or http://
2. You will then see a response object that shows a generated short URL, unique to the submitted URL.
3. You can then immediately put the provided short URL number into the broswer: /shorturl/<enter your short url here>
4. Et voila! Your will be redirected to the original URl you submitted
